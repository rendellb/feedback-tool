# Feedback Tool

This allows users to anonymously submit feedback to be displayed publicly on the front end and assigned to members of leadership to respond to on the backend. This was built using a Python Flask, MySQL, and basic web dev (HTML/CSS/JS with jQuery and Bootstrap). Database can be created from schema.sql.

## Features

* Anonymous submissions (optional indentification)
* Real-time related suggestions while typing feedback
* Order, filter, and search feedback and responses
* Upvoting submissions and responses
* Flagging responses for inaccuracy
* SLA indicators

* Ticketing system for leaders
* Moderate submissions before they're published
* Cron driven automatic assigning and re-assigning to leaders who are online
* Reviewing of responses by direct reports to reporting manager
* Amendment of incorrect responses
